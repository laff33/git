Sunday afternoon after a valuable victory for the Los Angeles Lakers in New Orleans, LeBron James asked aloud how many games he ended up playing in his just-concluded 21st NBA regular season.

The answer was officially 71, but really 72 if counting the in-season tournament championship game which awkwardly isn't counted. That's 16 (17, unofficially) more games than last season and the most in his six-year tenure with the Lakers.
